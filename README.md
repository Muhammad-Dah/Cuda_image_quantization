# Cuda_image_quantization

In this repo we will implement image quantization for grayscale
images. This method reduces the number of colors u sed in an image
Below
you can see a pair of images. On the left, the original image, and on
the right, the image after quantization to 4 colors

The algorithm we will implement works by first creating a histogram of the
gray levels in the image, then using the histogram to create a map w hich
maps each value of these levels to a new value, and finally, using this map to
create the new image.
We will implement quantization on MxN grayscale images, each represented
as a unsigned char array of length M*N, with values in the range [0,255],
w here 0 means black, and 255 means white.


We
perform quantization into L gray levels as follows:
1. Create a histogram h an array of length 256. h[v] is the number of pixels
which have the value v.
2. Create the cumulative distribution function CDF from the histogram.
CDF[v]=h[0]+h[1]+...+h[v]
3. Create a map m from old gray level to new gray level. m[v] is the new
value of pixels which originally had the value v.
m is computed as follows:

4. Compute the new image For each pixel ùëñ
new[ùëñ]=ùëö[original[ùëñ]]


The repository includes the following files:

`image_quantization.cu` :
GPU implementation of the algorithm
that is used to check the results.

`image_quantization-cpu.cu` :
CPU implementation of the algorithm
that is used to check the results.

`main.cu`:
test harness that runs your algorithm on
random images and compares the result
against the CPU implementation a bove, as
well as measure s performance.

`image.cu`:
test program that runs the CPU
implementation against an image file and
produces an output image file, for your
curiosity by running: ./image <imagefile>
  
`cat.jpg`:
cat shown above.

`Makefile`:
Allows building the exercise ex1 and the
graphical test application image using
make ex1 and make image respectively.
